# Airbus Ship Detection Challenge

- Dataset (and challenge description) can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/data).

- The goal of the project is to build a segmentation model to locate ships in images.

> Modeling wasn't fruitful, so no resulting model was provided. Plenty of work was done though, one could check the [notebook](notebook.ipynb) and train/inference scripts. Notebook contains EDA, visualization, preprocessing, modeling. Train script is usable. Inference script is kind of a mock at the moment. Availability of compute resource for more exploration/experimentation during modeling would be nice for this kind of project.

To install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
